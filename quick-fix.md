# Quick Fix Flat Rate Support
Our Get Me Out Of Trouble (“Quick-Fix”) process is a great way to get a hand with an urgent server/network issue which might only need a couple of hours of an expert’s time to resolve. This streamlined process is designed so that we can quickly help you on a fixed-fee basis. We will provide up to 4 hours of work to investigate and work on a resolution to your issue.

# WHAT QUICK FIXES CAN DO
* Password resets
* RAID hard drive issue – review/resolve
* Quick high-level security review
* Server health check
* Design / Architecture questions
* Linux mail server issue, such as SPF record analysis or file system problem
* Pick an engineer’s brain!
* Backup recovery
* Or some other issue for you to evaluate us with a small issue to experience what it’s like to work with us.

# WHAT QUICK FIXES CAN'T DO
* Not-urgent requests not demanding immediate attention
* Issues that cannot be solved or worked through in one technical session of up to 4 hours
* Project or issue that needs more than 4 hours to complete.
For other options such as hour blocks, please visit our linux consulting page

# How it works
* Submit the form below so that we have your information and the basic details collected.
* We will confirm receipt, and ask any clarifying details as required.

* We will send you an official proposal with T&Cs and Non-Disclosure Agreement

* When we get close to the time limit, we will provide a summary of where we are, findings, conclusions, and recommendations for the next step.

# Remote access
We provide all Linux/Devops consulting services remotely. Normally this is done using the SSH protocol. We can provide our static IPs so that you can add them to your firewall to open up the SSH ports, and can also provide our team’s public SSH keys. Alternative methods such as VPN, web consoles, remote desktop, screen sharing are less efficient. The easier you make it for us to get into your system, the more time we will have available to help you!

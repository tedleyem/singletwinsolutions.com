 What is OpenTofu?

OpenTofu is an open-source project that serves as a fork of the legacy MPL-licensed Terraform. It was developed as a response to a change in HashiCorp’s licensing of Terraform, from Mozilla Public License (MPL) to a Business Source License (BSL), which imposed limitations on the use of Terraform for commercial purposes. As an alternative, OpenTofu aims to offer a reliable, community-driven solution under the Linux Foundation.
Why OpenTofu matters in the DevOps ecosystem?

OpenTofu ensures that one of the core and most popular IaC tool remains open-source. With this you not only get an open-source Terraform alternative, but this also ensures the fact that the later deployment of OpenTofu will take advantage of the community’s feedback. 

In the DevOps world, OpenTofu’s significance is amplified by its capabilities of infrastructure management. It continues the legacy of Terraform by supporting infrastructure as code (IaC). This enables teams to automate and efficiently manage infrastructure deployment, crucial for enhancing operational scalability and reliability.

OpenTofu’s backward compatibility with Terraform’s infrastructure also means organizations deeply integrated with Terraform can transition without disrupting their existing workflows. This compatibility, coupled with the broad support from various organizations in the DevOps community, positions OpenTofu not just as a tool but as a potential standard in the evolving landscape of DevOps, supporting its principles of automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

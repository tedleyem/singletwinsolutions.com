Having a robust and timely backup and recovery strategy is critical to the long term success of a business because it ensures your data and day-to-day operating procedures can be restored seamlessly in the event of data loss or corruption.


SOFTWARE UPDATES

Keeping your company software up to date is important for several key reasons. Firstly, out of date software can leave vulnerabilities in your network that can potentially be exploited by hackers or malicious viruses. Secondly, legacy software installs can affect the performance and speed of a system, making it more inefficient. And thirdly, updated software can ensures compatibility with other systems and applications, reducing the risk of issues and errors.

Overall, updating software is an important part of maintaining the health and performance of you business network system so you must have a plan in place to make sure you are up to date.
